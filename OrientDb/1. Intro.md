## Multi-Model

Support Multi-Model Objects i.e document, graph, key/value & Real Object.
Has seperate api for all four models

* #### Document
    Date stored in key value pair/JSON
    Group of document is collection.
    It uses the concept of **Classes**, **Cluster**, & **Link** for Storing/Grouping & Analying documents.

* #### Graph
    Store data in the form of **Vertices**(Nodes) interconnected by **Edges**(Arcs).
    Class extend **V** for Vertex & **E** for Edges.

* #### Key/Value
    Store data in JSON format

* #### Object Model(Deprecated after v1.5)

## Record

Smallest unit that can be load from and store in database.
  * Document - JSON document
  * Record Bytes - 
  * Vertex - Graph DB node
  * Edge - Connect one vertex to another(Graph Db Arcs)

## Key Concept

  * RecordId - Unique id like key in  record.
  Format - cluster:position
  cluster is in which cluster record is available & position is sequence in which record is available
  * Class - 
  * Cluster - A place where group of class, records are stored.
      All record of class is stored in same cluster having same name as class.
     Max cluster in DB is **32,767(2^15-1)**
  * Relationship
      1. Referenced - stores direct link to the target objects of the relationships.
      2. Embedded(Stronger) - stores the relationship within the record that embeds it.

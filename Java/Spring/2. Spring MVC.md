Front Controller - In Spring Web MVC, the DispatcherServlet class works as the front controller. It is responsible to manage the flow of the Spring MVC application.
Model - A model contains the data of the application. A data can be a single object or a collection of objects.
Controller - A controller contains the business logic of an application.
View - A view represents the provided information in a particular format. Generally, JSP+JSTL is used to create a view page. Although spring also supports other view technologies such as Apache Velocity, Thymeleaf and FreeMarker.


The DispatcherServlet gets an entry of handler mapping from the XML file and forwards the request to the controller.
The controller returns an object of ModelAndView.
The DispatcherServlet checks the entry of view resolver in the XML file and invokes the specified view component.

# Constructor
  * It has same name as class.
  * A class can have more than one constructor.
  * It can have zero or more parameter.
  * It doesn't return value.
  * It can only be called with new operator.

# Implicit & Explicit parameter
  public void foo(number) {
    System.out.printLn(this.number + number)
  }
  this.number = 10;
  this.foo(55) // 65
  here two parameter are passed.
  #### Explicit parameter
    55 is explicit parameter
  #### Implicit Parameter
    this is impliit parameter as instanc eis passed and it use number variable of this instance.

# Public/Private/Final/

# Static
  There is one static field per class.
    Static -> Exposed the fn/var to JVM
    Static field has single instance.
    If 100 instance of a class is created, static instance is still only one and belongs to class, not individual object
    Static method are kind of those method who doesn't have any imlicit parameter e.g -> math.pow(x,y) i.e doesnot have this parameter

# Setter/Getter method should return cloned data as sending same data will break encapsulation


# Constructors
 ## Overloading
 It means multiple fn avaible with same name with different parameter.
 Which fn will call is based on the number of parameter passed.

 To initialize some data before constructor is called define those in root of main fn/outside of constructor
  # Call another constructor from constructor
  this("param1", "param2") // inside constructor.

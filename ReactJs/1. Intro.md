ReactDom
=> ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container)
    Unmount the react component from DOM & removed all event handler & state
    Return true if it is component is mounted else return false

=> ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component)  (can't used on functional)
    it is used to get native browser dom node if component is mounted.
    Deprecated in strict mode

=> ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
=> ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])
    Render the react component in DOM in required container.
    If component is already rendered it will only muteate the browser dom by finding difference in component using their own algorithm

=> ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container[, callback])

ReactDomServer

=> ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element)
    Render a react component to html string in server side(used for SEO)
    Combining it with hydrate will give faster response

=> ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(element)
    Similar to renderToString except it removes extra dom attributes that react uses like "data-reactroot"

* renderToString, renderToStaticMarkup can be used on both server & browser environments

=> ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream(element)
    Same as renderToString 

=> ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticNodeStream(element)
    Same as renderToNodeStream

* renderToNodeStream, renderToStaticNodeStream can be used only in server environment

DOM Elements
* All DOM properties & attributes are camelCased except aria-* & data-*
=> className
=> checked(input -> radio, checkbox), value(input, textarea)
    used to build controlled component
    defaultChecked is uncontrolled equivalent
=> dangerouslySetInnerHTML ({__html: 'First &middot; Second'})
    __html shows that this is risky(Could lead to cross site scripting(XSS attack))
=> htmlFor
=> onChange -> Fires when any form field is changed
=> selected (option dom)
=> style -> camelCased and as an object, automatically add px to numeric values
=> suppressContentEditableWarning
=> suppressHydrationWarning
* After react 16 all dom attributes are supported in React.

SyntheticEvent
* All event are wrapper of SyntheticEvent, a cross browser wrapper around browser event.
* Can access browser event using nativeEvent key.
* All event name will be camelCase
* In JSX we pass function as event handler rather than string.

Controlled & UnControlled Component
